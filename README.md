# OHA Incentive Measures.

Implementation of the OHA Incentive Measures.

This component provides outputs that conform to the quality metric output schema expected by PRM/analytics-pipeline.

Will eventually include both claims and clinical based metrics.

## Branching Strategy
This repository utilizes full [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

## Integration

Somewhat TBD.  Will provide a runner to be accessed via `%OHA_INCENTIVE_MEASURES_HOME%`.  Will also likely include a Luigi pipeline.
